    "For Loop:\n",
    "A for loop is ideal when you know the number of times you want to repeat a specific task. It's commonly used for iterating over a fixed sequence like a list, tuple, range, or string. The syntax of a for loop is generally simpler and more concise compared to a while loop.\n",

    "A while loop is suitable when you want to repeat a task until a certain condition becomes false. The loop will continue to execute as long as the specified condition is true. It's often used when the exact number of iterations is uncertain.\n",
